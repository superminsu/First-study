        <p>Today, i woke up at 08:00 and go to the bathroom. After that, i ate breakfast. my dog name is Azzi.
            It's fun. I went for a walk in the park with my dog. My dog was excited.
            After that, i studied english and coding for an hour. what we learned today was web server install and connect.
